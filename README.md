## About the App
This is a react front-end for a very specific use-case. The tag data for characters in fan fiction websites is
very messy, characters are often misspelled or augmented. An additional problem for the Tolkien universe is
the same characters often have multiple names (eg. Mithrandir/Gandalf). This loads each character into a form
and allows quickly editing it to a canonical name, then saves that data in a text file used to process the 
fan fiction scraped data (see [here](https://github.com/MikeDPhillips/middle_earth)).
